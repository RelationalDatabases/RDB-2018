<p>Identify the Entities, optional and mandatory Attributes, unique identifiers, and relationships (including optionality and cardinality) for the following business description:</p>
<p>Splash n&#39; Stretch is a leisure centre with both a gym and swimming pool. All users of the facilities must be members. Classes are taught in the leisure centre for members. Members must register for classes and some classes require additional payment. In addition, members must provide the instructor with any medical/ health issues which may affect their participation, for example, if a members is asthmatic, has a heart problem, has epilepsy etc. Each class is taught by a qualified staff member from the gym or pool departments. Employees consist of cleaners, office staff, receptionists, gym instructors, and lifeguards. Each department has its own manager. Each employee has a unique employee ID, PPS number, name, address, phone number and start date. The leisure centre requires that all staff are qualified in first aid. This qualification must be renewed every two years. Lifeguard qualifications also need to be renewed every two years and the gym instructors must also hold the necessary qualifications.</p>
<p>Once you have identified everything, draw the diagram.
Check that all the relationships are drawn correctly by using the ERDish technique.</p>

        <h1>Exercises</h1>
<p>You are a small database consulting company specializing in developing databases
for the medical industry. You have just been awarded the contract to develop a data
model for a database application system for a mid-size health insurance company to
keep track of health claims including patient information, provider(doctor)
information, information about patient visits to their doctor as well as prescription
drugs prescribed to patients.</p>
<p>Information such as patient name, address, phone, email etc. are needed as well as
who each patient’s primary care doctor is, their insurance ID number and insurance
company name. We also want information on each doctor such as their specialty
and what hospitals they are affiliated with as well as their phone, address etc.
Regarding the hospitals themselves we will need to know where they are located
and how to contact them.</p>
<p>The prescriptions given to each patient by a health-care provider also need to be
tracked in this particular database at this time to determine claim eligibility including
some basic information on the drug being prescribed to make sure there are no
conflicts with a patient’s other prescriptions. We need to know each drug’s name,
purpose/use and possible side effects.</p>
<p>Eventually, the database will be used to track trends and for some extrapolative
modeling based on the accumulated data. The database will be accessible in English
only right now, although plans include making it available in multiple languages
eventually.</p>
<p>Based on the business scenario stated above you will identify the database needs,
and then create a conceptual data model to support these needs.</p>
<ol>
<li>Review the types of information a medical database may contain. Read articles
and check  the internet to understand the challenges of tracking this information.</li>
<li>Research medical information to better understand your topic. Look for the type of
information you will need to track.</li>
<li>Build a list of business needs, rules and assumptions based on your scenario,
research, and objectives.</li>
<li>Develop a list of potential entities including their attributes, the attribute’s
optionality as well as a possible UID for each entity.</li>
<li>Create a preliminary Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) that meets these needs
and objectives.</li>
</ol>
